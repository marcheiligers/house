# House

Based on [jellymann/mittsu-tank-demo](https://github.com/jellymann/mittsu-tank-demo) which is a demo for [jellymann/mittsu](https://github.com/jellymann/mittsu), this is an experiment where I'm trying to create a walk-through of our house and the extensions we want to build.

## Development

`export MITTSU_LIBGLFW_FILE=libglfw.3.dylib`

`bundle exec ruby start.rb`
